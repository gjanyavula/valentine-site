  You are the cutest thing in the world, and I want to kiss you and hug you all day. I’m so thankful I get to have you in my life. Every time I look into your eyes, I fall for you all over again. Congrats on UVA, you earned it, and I’m so proud of you! You are the kindest soul I know, and no one deserves success more than you.<br><br>
  Kisses x 1,000,000 😘<br><br>
  Yours always,<br><br>
  Gautham <br><br>
  PS: I would love to take you on another date
